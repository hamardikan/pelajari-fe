## Technical Implementation

### Updated Files
- ✅ **`src/utils/constants.ts`** - New API endpoints
- ✅ **`src/services/idp.ts`** - Simplified service methods
- ✅ **`src/store/idpStore.ts`** - Updated store for file uploads
- ✅ **`src/pages/IDPPage.tsx`** - Full UI restoration with new backend integration

### Added Dependencies

- 🗑️ **GapAnalysisWizard** - Replaced with modal dialog approach

## User Experience

### 🚀 **Improved Workflow**
1. **Start from Overview** - See current status at a glance
2. **Perform Gap Analysis** - Upload files via beautiful drag-and-drop interface
3. **View Results** - Animated visualizations of gap analysis
4. **Generate IDP** - One-click plan generation
5. **Track Progress** - Visual progress indicators and goal management

### 🎯 **Visual Enhancements**
- **Smooth page transitions** between tabs
- **Real-time progress updates** during analysis
- **Intuitive file upload** with visual feedback
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
- **Consistent color scheme** throughout the application

## Build Status
